# Compressively Sensed Ultrasound Radio-frequency Data Reconstruction Using Combined Curvelet and WaveAtom Basis

This [paper](https://arafathm.github.io/assets/pdf/mah2015a.pdf) proposed a CCW-based reconstruction method to recover the original ultrasound RF signal using a combined orthonormal sparsifying domain that consists of curvelets and wave atoms coefficients. The compressive sensing (CS) theory allows to recover a signal sampled below the Nyquist sampling limit under certain assumptions. CS provide optimized ultrasound imaging solutions that also has the potential to offer a coherent framework for image analysis, object detection, and information extraction. CS can also improve efficiency of triplex acquisitions for CFM/B-mode/Doppler or 3D imaging using matrix arrays.
